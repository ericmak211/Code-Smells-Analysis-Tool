The tool would collect data on current project timelines and resource allocation, including hours and costs associated with tasks. It would allow users to input proposed refactoring tasks, specifying the expected hours and costs for each. The tool would then analyze the potential impacts by comparing the added refactoring efforts against the current project schedule and resources. It would provide a report detailing the changes in project timelines, additional costs, and resource adjustments needed, helping project managers make informed decisions about refactoring efforts.
