This project explores the design issues caused by over-refactoring, which can delay projects and drain resources. We discuss the negative impacts on projects through case studies and analysis and propose practical solutions to manage refactoring effectively. By balancing code improvements with feature development, teams can avoid the risks of over-refactoring and keep projects on track.
